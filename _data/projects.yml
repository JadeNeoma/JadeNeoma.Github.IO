  description: Valrie, the Crystal Company’s best rogue, has struck out on her own after her fiancee, Aileia, dumped her. Six months of living on her own has given her a new perspective on life and she’s enjoyed doing smaller work than the huge bounties she picked up with the company. She’s resigned herself to solitude as she’s never been good with people, especially if she cares about them. Saria has wanted more her whole life, reading books about heroes and adventure. When her best friend suggests they sneak into a backroom disguised as Rogues she is instantly excited until her friend backs out claiming it to have only been a joke. Undeterred she decides to go alone, her adventure finding her as she’s saved from a fight by a raven-haired ratcatcher.

  role: Author
  duration: Late 2024/Early 2025
  description: This isn’t a love story, though there is one tucked away inside it. Angela has been depressed for longer than she cares to admit. Her friends all got busy with their lives and she has sunk deeper and deeper into the gnawing nothingness that she has been wading in since high school. Most days she doesn’t get out of bed, on the ones she does, she moves around her house like a ghost not willing to disturb the world enough to be noticed.   Even a chance at love cannot pull her out of her own head long enough for her to even glimpse happiness. Can her rallying friends pull her out of her spiral before she hits the floor?
